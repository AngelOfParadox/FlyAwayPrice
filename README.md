# 💸Add those cents you've always wanted!💸
Are you tired of looking at prices with unnecessary decimal places? Do you find yourself constantly rounding up or down to get a more accurate idea of how much you're spending? Well, fear not! This JavaScript code will do the job for you!

👉 By adding this extension to your browser, all prices on the Amazon website will be automatically rounded to the nearest whole number. Say goodbye to those decimal places! 👋

# How it works 🤔
The script uses regular expressions to find prices in the format "$x.xx" and then rounds them to the nearest whole number. It also adds a mouseover event to show the original price and a mouseout event to show the rounded price again.

# Study shows it works! 📈
According to a study by Thomas and Morwitz (2005), prices ending in 99 are more effective at inducing purchase behavior compared to other price endings. By using 99-ending prices, businesses can potentially increase their sales and profits without significantly changing the actual price of their products. So, by rounding prices to the nearest whole number, this script could actually be helping you save money and making Amazon even more profitable! 🤑

💡 In the study, Thomas and Morwitz (2005) conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effect of 99-ending prices on consumer behavior. They found that prices ending in 99 were more effective at inducing purchase behavior compared to other price endings, such as 00 or 50.

The researchers suggest that this phenomenon, known as the "left-digit effect," occurs because consumers tend to focus on the leftmost digit of a price, which can create a perception of a larger difference between prices. For example, consumers may perceive the difference between $1.99 and $2.00 as more significant than the actual difference of only one cent.

🧐 Additionally, the study found that the effect of 99-ending prices was more pronounced for products with higher prices, such as jewelry or furniture, compared to lower-priced products like gum or snacks.

Overall, the findings of this study have important implications for pricing strategies in retail and e-commerce settings. By using 99-ending prices, businesses can potentially increase their sales and profits without significantly changing the actual price of their products.

# Usage 💻🔧
Once the extension is installed and the Amazon.com website is open, the code will automatically round all prices displayed on the website to the nearest whole number or up to the nearest whole number if the original price ends in 9. This is great news for those of us who hate the brainwashing that marketing does to us on a daily basis.! 🙅‍♀️

Additionally, the code will show the original price when the user hovers over the rounded price and revert back to the rounded price when the user moves the mouse away from the price. So you can still see the original price and appreciate the left-digit bias.💸
